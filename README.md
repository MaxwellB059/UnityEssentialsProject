# THIS WAS THE FIRST INSTANCE OF MY USE OF UNITY THIS SEMESTER

I didn't quite understand the idea of commits over time. I didn't think that showing my learning of Unity counted as something I should document during the semester.

I begun this tutorial in Late October, 2025.

As I cannot post this pre-made Unity File into the repository, I'll provide photo screenshot evidence that I worked on it.
